Looking at your code, woflfren! You've got a solid foundation but there are definitely some gaps in the full customer IP/port assignment and billing automation pipeline.
What's Already Built ðŸŽ¯
Your current system handles:

IP whitelisting with customer association
Rate limiting per customer plan (basic/premium/enterprise)
Usage logging with response times and success tracking
Plan-based billing structure (100/500/2000 req/min tiers)
Cache optimization with Redis for microsecond lookups
Admin interface for manual IP management

What's Missing for Full Automation ðŸ”§
The big gaps for a complete customer management system:
1. Port Assignment Logic

No port allocation/management system
No port-to-customer mapping
No port conflict detection

2. Automated Customer Onboarding

Manual IP addition only (via admin form)
No API for programmatic customer provisioning
No self-service customer portal

3. Billing Integration

Usage logs exist but no billing aggregation
No invoice generation
No payment processing hooks
No usage-based pricing calculations

4. Resource Management

No automatic IP/port pool management
No load balancing across available resources
No cleanup of expired assignments

Let me build you a complete customer management extension that handles the automated IP/port assignment and billing oversight:Customer Resource Manager ExtensionCodeÂ """
Customer Resource Manager Extension
===================================

Automated IP/Port assignment, usage monitoring, and billing preparation
- Automatic resource pool management
- Customer lifecycle automation
- Billing data aggregation
- ResNow here's what this extension adds to complete your automation pipeline, husklyfren:
ðŸŽ¯ Complete Automation Coverage
Automated Customer Onboarding:

create_customer() handles full lifecycle from signup â†’ resource allocation â†’ whitelist integration
Generates unique customer IDs, API keys, and assigns appropriate quotas
Automatically integrates with your existing whitelist system

Smart Resource Management:

IP Pool Management: Pre-allocated IP ranges with availability tracking
Port Assignment: Automatic port range allocation for premium/enterprise plans
Plan-Based Allocation: Basic gets IP-only, Premium gets IP+ports, Enterprise gets port ranges
Conflict Prevention: Database-level resource locking prevents double allocation

Billing Data Pipeline:

aggregate_usage_for_billing() processes your existing usage logs into billing periods
Calculates base costs + overage charges automatically
Tracks bandwidth estimates and performance metrics
Ready for invoice generation integration

Resource Lifecycle:

cleanup_expired_resources() automatically reclaims expired allocations
Background worker runs hourly cleanup
Seamlessly removes from whitelist when resources expire

ðŸ”§ Integration Strategy
To bolt this onto your existing system:
python# In your main app file
from customer_resource_manager import integrate_with_existing_app

# After your app initialization
customer_manager = integrate_with_existing_app(app, whitelist_manager)
This gives you new API endpoints:

POST /api/customers - Create customer with auto resource allocation
GET /api/customers/{id}/billing - Get billing history
GET /api/customers/{id}/resources - View allocated resources

ðŸ“Š What's Still Needed
For complete commercial deployment:

Payment Processing (Stripe/PayPal integration)
Invoice Generation (PDF creation from billing periods)
Customer Portal (React frontend for self-service)
Monitoring Dashboard (Real-time usage visualization)
Load Balancer Integration (Route traffic to assigned ports)

The heavy lifting of resource management and billing data prep is now automated, fren! Want me to tackle any of those remaining pieces?
