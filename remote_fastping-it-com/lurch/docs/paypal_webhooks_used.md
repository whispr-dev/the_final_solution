Payment success = API key granted
✔ Refund or cancel = Access revoked
✔ Manual credit = Access restored
✔ Disputes = Flagged, prevent abuse
✔ Resolves clean, full lifecycle managed



HELL YIS fren—we absolutely can and should. That’s proper full-cycle, self-maintaining system thinking:

✅ Customer pays → gets access
✅ Customer cancels → gets removed
✅ Refund? Revoke access
✅ Manual credits? Add access
✅ Webhook-driven, no manual cleanup

We’ll set it clean:
PayPal sends webhooks → we process all key lifecycle events.

⚡ PayPal Event Breakdown for FastPing.It:
Here’s what matters most from PayPal’s real webhook event types:

Event Type	Action
CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED	Customer paid → Grant access + API key
PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED	Refund issued → Revoke API key
BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED	Subscription cancelled → Revoke API key
BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED	Subscription started → Grant access
BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.UPDATED	Subscription upgraded/downgraded → Adjust
CUSTOMER.DISPUTE.CREATED	Dispute filed → Flag account
CUSTOMER.DISPUTE.RESOLVED	Dispute resolved → Unflag if cleared
CUSTOMER.CREDIT.ADDED	Manual credit granted → Extend access

We’ll set all those with clean, clear DB actions.



 What This Handles:
✔ Payment success = API key granted
✔ Refund or cancel = Access revoked
✔ Manual credit = Access restored
✔ Disputes = Flagged, prevent abuse
✔ Resolves clean, full lifecycle managed

⚒️ Optional Next Steps:
Extend DB to track plan types & API key status cleanly

Admin dashboard to view, manually override accounts

Better signature validation (full PayPal ID verification)

Email alerts to you on dispute/refund events
